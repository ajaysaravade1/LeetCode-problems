### 238. Product of Array Except Self

Given an array nums of n integers where n > 1,  return an array output such that output[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

### Example:
Input:  [1,2,3,4]

Output: [24,12,8,6]
### Constraint: 
It's guaranteed that the product of the elements of any prefix or suffix of the array (including the whole array) fits in a 32 bit integer.

### Note:
Please solve it without division and in O(n).

### Follow up:
Could you solve it with constant space complexity? (The output array does not count as extra space for the purpose of space complexity analysis.)

```python
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        left = []
        right = [1 for i in range(len(nums))]
        mul=1
        left.append(1)
        left.append(1)
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            mul = nums[i]*mul
            left.append(mul)
        mul =1
        j = len(nums)-1
        for i in range(len(nums)-1,0,-1):
            mul = nums[i]*mul
            right[j] = mul
            j-=1
        right.append(1)
        
        out = []
        print(left,right)
        for i in range(1,len(right)):
            out.append(left[i]*right[i])
        
        return out
  ```
