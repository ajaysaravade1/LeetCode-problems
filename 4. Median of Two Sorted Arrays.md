### 4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays

There are two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively.
Find the median of the two sorted arrays. The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).
You may assume nums1 and nums2 cannot be both empty.

### Example 1:
nums1 = [1, 3]
nums2 = [2]

The median is 2.0

### Example 2:

nums1 = [1, 2]
nums2 = [3, 4]

The median is (2 + 3)/2 = 2.5

```python
class Solution:
    def findMedianSortedArrays(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> float:
        merge_list = nums1 + nums2
        
        merge_list.sort()-
        length = len(merge_list)
        
        if(length%2==0):
            return (merge_list[length//2-1] + merge_list[length//2]) / 2
        else:
            return float(merge_list[length//2])
```
