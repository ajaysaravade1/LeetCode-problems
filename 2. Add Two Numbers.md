### 2. Add Two Numbers

You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers. The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit. Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.

You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

### Example:
Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)

Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8

Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.

### Solution:
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        ele1 = 0
        i = 1
        while l1!=None :
            ele1 = l1.val*i+ele1
            l1 = l1.next
            i*=10
         
        ele2=0
        i=1
        while l2!=None :
            ele2 = l2.val*i+ele2
            l2 = l2.next
            i*=10
        out = ele1 + ele2
        
        head = ListNode()
        r_head = head
        while out!=0:
            mod = out % 10
            out = out // 10
            head.val = mod
            if out!=0:
                free = ListNode()
            else:
                free = None
            head.next = free
            head = free

        return r_head
```
